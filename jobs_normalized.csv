==================


Yuma is building a complete orchestration platform that deploys autonomous AI agents dedicated to customer support in e\-commerce. We are one of the leaders in this space and we offer one of the most advanced platforms to date, supporting over 100 paying customers. Our agents replicate human capabilities by taking actions and retrieving information from external services as needed.


Our top merchants automate over 80% of their support tickets through Yuma.


Yuma was founded by Guillaume Luccisano, a 3rd time YC founder, and now boasts a team of 20 highly dedicated, talented people driven to deliver the best value to our customers through AI.

**Role Overview**
-----------------


We remain a small team of 5 engineers, but we are intense and we move very quickly! Fast iteration is key. In the past 2 years since Yuma’s founding, we’ve built a lot, but there is still much more to do! We operate at startup speed and handle everything: product iterations, A/B testing, LLM research, AI Agents pipeline, new feature development, performance optimizations, and more. We are intensely focused on delivering value to our users and on product excellence. That is the only thing that matters.


Our backend is a standard Ruby on Rails API powered by PostgreSQL, Redis, and Sidekiq. Our frontend uses Next.js and React. We already handle a significant load, ingesting and processing millions of support tickets per month and millions of e\-commerce data points per day.


We are definitely not a 9\-to\-5 team, and we are heavily committed to delivering excellence throughout our craft.

**The ideal You:**
------------------


You have led and built multiple large Rails applications, and you always strive for excellence. You are pragmatic, making the right trade\-offs that favor speed of iteration while maintaining high product quality. You are driven by delivering the best experience and value to your users. You might have a preference for working on backend projects, but you aren't afraid of frontend work. Rails has no secrets for you.


Recent experience playing with LLMs is now mandatory, and you have already adopted AI in your day\-to\-day tasks. Building with LLMs and managing non\-deterministic output is not scary to you.


If you are relentless, deeply caring about delivering value \& ownership, and looking to join an early, hard\-working team, we want you . We are seeking someone who is looking to embrace a new challenge and commit to it 100%.


Your diploma doesn't matter to us; we only care about your skills, your sense of ownership, and drive.

**The Alternative You:**
------------------------


If you’re still junior, but the description above sounds like the person you aim to become in the next 3 years, don’t be shy: there’s always space for raw talent at Yuma.

### **OUR CULTURE**

**Join the Future of Commerce with Whatnot!**
Whatnot is the largest livestream shopping platform in North America and Europe to buy, sell, and discover the things you love. We’re re\-defining e\-commerce by blending community, shopping, and entertainment into a community just for you. As a remote co\-located team, we’re inspired by innovation and anchored in our values. With hubs in the US, UK, Ireland, Poland, and Germany, we’re building the future of online marketplaces—together.


From fashion, beauty, and electronics to rare collectibles like trading cards, comic books, and even live plants, our live auctions have something for everyone.


And we’re just getting started! As one of the fastest growing marketplaces, we’re looking for bold, forward\-thinking problem solvers across all functional areas. Check out the latest Whatnot updates on our news and engineering blogs and join us as we enable anyone to turn their passion into a business, and bring people together through commerce.

  

**Role**


Seller Growth is responsible for growing sellers on Whatnot — enabling them to turn their hobbies into businesses. Within Seller Growth, the Platform pod ensures that this growth is sustainable, trustworthy, and scalable.


As our next software engineer on the Seller Growth Platform pod, you will design and build the systems that sit at the heart of the new seller funnel. Your work will focus on:

* **Protecting the funnel from fraud and abuse:** Developing and scaling systems for identity verification (IDV), fraud detection, and automated trust/risk reviews that safeguard buyers while minimizing friction for good sellers.
* **Balancing growth with trust and safety:** Ensuring that the thousands of new sellers joining weekly can sell successfully without degrading the buyer experience, while preventing bad actors from gaining distribution or abusing incentives.
* **Building platform intelligence:** Powering accurate seller identification (e.g., enrichment data, signals, and predictive LTV models) to route sellers to the right onboarding, incentive, and discovery paths.
* **Creating scalable infrastructure:** Partnering with Data Science and Trust teams to design reusable trust and reputation systems, modular fraud prevention frameworks, and experimentation platforms that other pods and teams across Whatnot can leverage.
* **Driving long\-term seller success:** Enabling better bucketing of sellers by value and risk profile, ensuring that high\-potential sellers are accelerated early, while low\-quality or fraudulent sellers are contained before they reach scale.


This pod works at the intersection of growth, trust, and platform\-ization. You’ll be responsible for deeply technical systems (IDV, fraud signal repositories, seller enrichment pipelines, predictive models) that directly influence GMV, seller retention, and buyer trust. The pace is fast: every week, thousands of sellers apply to sell, and your work ensures that Whatnot can confidently scale this influx without compromising marketplace integrity.

* Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science or related field or equivalent work experience.
* Experience building scalable systems (we primarily use Python, Elixir, JavaScript).

* Excellent product instincts. You first think about users rather than the best technical solution.
* Proven track record of delivering features. You are known for shipping products and features lightning\-fast.
* Ability to take ownership of an ambiguous area and define and then drive impact.
* Ability to flexibly work across multiple workstreams, thriving in a fast\-paced environment.
* Knowledge of data and growht systems like notifications.
* Scalability and data pipeline experience with SQL, dbt, etc.

* Retirement; 401k offering for Traditional and Roth accounts in the US (employer match up to 4% of base salary) and Pension plans internationally
* Monthly allowance to dogfood the app
	+ All Whatnauts are expected to develop a deep understanding of our product. We're passionate about building the best user experience, and all employees are expected to use Whatnot as both a buyer and a seller as part of their job (our dogfooding budget makes this fun and easy!).
* Parental Leave
	+ 16 weeks of paid parental leave \+ one month gradual return to work \*company leave allowances run concurrently with country leave requirements which take precedence.

* **Optimize performance** for speed, scalability, and cost\-efficiency across distributed systems.
* **Mentor junior engineers** and foster a culture of technical excellence and innovation.
* **Stay ahead of the curve** on blockchain, smart contracts, and AI technologies — integrating them where they create real impact.

**We’re Excited About You Because You Have:**
---------------------------------------------

* A **self\-starter mindset** and the drive to tackle big challenges head\-on.
* Strong **TypeScript proficiency** and **Node.js** backend development expertise.
* Experience with **PostgreSQL or MySQL** and sound database design skills.
* Solid **system design skills** to scale from 10s to 1000s of RPS.

(GA\-I3\)** develops cutting\-edge software solutions that transform raw data into actionable intelligence. We specialize in real\-time global situational awareness and battle management, processing petabytes of data from hundreds of sources across air, land, and sea. Our systems—including the widely used **THRESHER** and **DRAGONSPELL** platforms—support tens of thousands of users at all levels of the DoD and Intelligence Community and enable critical decision\-making for national security missions.  

We process **hundreds of thousands of observations per minute**, operating at the scale of global sensor networks and battlefield telemetry. Our backend architecture leverages technologies like **Kafka**, **AWS**, **NiFi**, and **GeoMesa**—the latter of which we designed and open\-sourced—to deliver high\-throughput, mission\-resilient systems that turn streaming data into real\-time intelligence.

**Why GA\-I3?**

GA\-I3 combines the staying power of an experienced defense contractor with the agility and values of a mission\-focused technology company. We’ve spent decades building systems our users love—trusted tools used daily by operators and analysts across the national security community. Our customers keep coming back because we deliver what we promise, and our engineers stay because they get to solve real problems that truly matter.  

We’re not a flashy startup. We don’t chase headlines—we focus on delivering reliable capabilities with long\-term impact. And while we share DNA with traditional defense contractors, we operate differently. As a privately held company, we make decisions based on what’s right for the mission, not for a quarterly earnings call. We move fast when it counts, think long\-term, and hold ourselves to the highest technical and ethical standards.  

If you're looking for a place where you can build real systems, solve hard problems, and serve a higher purpose—without the red tape—GA\-I3 is where you belong.

**What You’ll Do**


We are seeking **Frontend Software Engineers** to help build the next generation of global situational awareness and battle orchestration capabilities.
  

  

**What We Believe**


These values weren’t crafted in a branding session—they were observed and articulated after 35 years of building software that matters. They reflect how we work, what we value in each other, and the kind of impact we want to have. At GA\-I3, they aren’t aspirational—they’re how we operate.

* **Solving Meaningful Challenges** – Building mission\-driven technology that makes a difference
* **Collaborative Culture** – Working as a team to push boundaries and innovate
* **Technical Excellence** – Encouraging continuous learning, curiosity, and efficiency
* **Idea Meritocracy** – Valuing ideas based on impact, not hierarchy


If these principles resonate with you—not just in theory, but in daily practice—you’ll find yourself at home here.

**DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:**

* Design and develop frontend applications for battlefield command and control and geospatial data visualization.
* Review code contributions using software engineering best practices for readability, maintainability, testing, security, performance, etc.
* Contribute to the evolution of our development processes, tools, and technologies to enhance efficiency and product quality.
* Collaborate effectively with team members, other engineering teams, and stakeholders to deliver robust solutions to challenging problems.

We recognize and appreciate the value and contributions of individuals with diverse backgrounds and experiences and welcome all qualified individuals to apply.

After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn't work together.



So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we've embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise\-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us.

As part of the AWS Applied AI Solutions organization, we have a vision to provide business applications, leveraging Amazon’s unique experience and expertise, that are used by millions of companies worldwide to manage day\-to\-day operations. We will accomplish this by accelerating our customers’ businesses through delivery of intuitive and differentiated technology solutions that solve enduring business challenges. We blend vision with curiosity and Amazon’s real\-world experience to build opinionated, turnkey solutions. Where customers prefer to buy over build, we become their trusted partner with solutions that are no\-brainers to buy and easy to use.  

  

An SDE II in the Retail Integration Merchant experience team in the Just Walk Out organization is an autonomous contributor, and their work is of high quality. They work independently and with their team to invent, design, and build software that is stable and performant. They are proficient in a broad range of frontend (web apps), backend (AWS services), and low\-level system technologies and design approaches and know when it is appropriate to use them (and when it is not). They consider the legacy of the code they produce and write code that any SDE unfamiliar with the system can understand. They create flexible software without over\-engineering and making appropriate trade\-offs, reuse where possible, and are cautious about introducing dependencies. They keep costs in mind when proposing solutions. They help their team evolve by actively participating in the code review process, design discussions, team planning, and ticket/metric/COE reviews. They focus on operational excellence, constructively identifying problems, and proposing solutions. They can train new teammates on how to develop the team's software, how to operate it, how to secure it, and how to fit it in the bigger picture. They foster constructive dialogue, seek resolutions professionally, help recruit and interview for the team, and mentor junior engineers on the team.  

  

About the team  

The Retail Platform team in Physical Stores Organization is responsible for the retail systems integration that is needed for 3P retailers to use the Just Walk Out (JWO) technology as a service in their physical stores. The charter includes retail data ingestion (catalog and price information), payment processing, compliance, seller fees, taxes, accounting, and self\-service tools that enable non\-Amazon retailers to adopt Amazon's physical retail technology products. The focus of the Merchant Experience team team has been Merchant setup (including deposit methods, tax settings, and legal entity), Store setup, Catalog Ingestion, Business Reports and Analytics, and 3P Retailer Customer Center (3PCC) for self service functions to upload and download data related to their JWO\-enabled physical stores.

You will spend time in developer forums and engage authentically in technical discussions where AI development tools naturally fit. You will collaborate with product teams on upcoming features, testing beta releases, or creating content that addresses real developer pain points you have discovered through community engagement. You might end the day preparing for a conference talk or writing a technical blog post that breaks down complex integration patterns into actionable steps.  

  

About the team  

We are developers who advocate for tools that help developers, focused on creating content that solves practical development challenges. Our mission is to demonstrate how AI\-powered development tools integrate naturally into existing workflows while delivering measurable productivity improvements.

We are looking for experienced builders who want to help other builders maximize their productivity with these tools while influencing the future of developer productivity.  

  

As a Developer Advocate on our Developer Productivity team, you will work directly with the teams building these tools while helping thousands of developers worldwide understand their practical applications. This highly visible role within AWS offers the opportunity to establish yourself as a recognized expert in AI\-assisted development, with direct influence on the future of these tools through your content, community engagement, and product feedback.

About the team  

We are developers who advocate for tools that help developers, focused on creating content that solves practical development challenges. Our mission is to demonstrate how AI\-powered development tools integrate naturally into existing workflows while delivering measurable productivity improvements. We work directly with the developer community to understand real pain points and collaborate with product and engineering teams to improve developer experience by bringing community feedback into product development. Our approach emphasizes showing working code over abstract concepts, engaging as technical peers, and sharing authentic development experiences including challenges and failures.
